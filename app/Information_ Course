!//Mobilerist design //

Design around a smaller screen first 
forces to PRIORITIZE conent
anitcotpate most common user actions ( due to lower attentionspan on mobilephone)


no valid exuse to NOT make any website a moblie fist website !



!//MIXINS
 define a Mixinfile with screen width variables. 
 fe . atSmall atLarge at Medium ...etc.
 


//Lazy Loader// 
Idea is: only load Data when it will be necessary!
Will define how and when the browser is loading data!
// if not applied browser will load ALL data at initial siteload!

-- when it comes to independet packages as Lazysides it is best to IMPORT them in a SEPERTATE JSfile !
